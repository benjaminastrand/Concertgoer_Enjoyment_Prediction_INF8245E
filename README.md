# Concertgoer_Enjoyment_Prediction_INF8245E

Kaggle competition as part of the course INF8245E Machine Learning that I took during my exchange year at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

The repository includes
* 1 Jupyter notebook with only the best-performing classifier
* 1 Jupyter notebook with all classifiers that we trained and tested during the Kaggle competition
* Our final report where we discuss our approach and the different classifiers that we trained and tested
