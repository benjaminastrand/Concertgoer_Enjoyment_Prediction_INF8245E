# Concertgoer_Enjoyment_Prediction_INF8245E #

Kaggle competition as part of the course INF8245E Machine Learning that I took during my exchange year at Polytechnique Montr√©al. The objective of this competition was to use our learnings from the course to create a prediction model for concertgoer enjoyment based on tabular data. The dataset included data about the venue, the band and the concertgoer.

#### The repository includes ####
* 1 Jupyter notebook with only the best-performing classifier
* 1 Jupyter notebook with all classifiers that we trained and tested during the Kaggle competition
* Our final report where we discuss our approach and the different classifiers that we trained and tested
